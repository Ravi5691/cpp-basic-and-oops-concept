Arithmetic Operator : 
+	                    addition
-	                    subtraction
*	                    multiplication
/	                    division
%	                    modulo(remainder)

Increment and Decrement: 
y += x;                	y = y + x;
x -= 5;	                x = x - 5;
x /= y;	                x = x / y;
price *= units + 1;	    price = price * (units+1);

Relational Operator : 
==	                    Equal to
!=	                    Not equal to
<	                    Less than
>	                    Greater than
<=	                    Less than or equal to
>=	                    Greater than or equal to

Logical Operator : 
!                       if condition is true than give false 
&&                      and (true true = true , false true = false)
||                      or (true true = true , false true = true)

Comma Operator :
 ,

CONDITIONAL TERNARY OPERATOR ( ? )

condition ? result1 : result2
ex - 5>3 ? a : b  // evaluates to the value of a, since 5 is greater than 3.
     a>b ? a : b      // evaluates to whichever is greater, a or b. 

Bitwise Operator : 
&	AND	Bitwise AND
|	OR	Bitwise inclusive OR
^	XOR	Bitwise exclusive OR
~	NOT	Unary complement (bit inversion)
<<	SHL	Shift bits left
>>	SHR	Shift bits right
